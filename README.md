### 1.) DATASET PREPARATION

#### 1.1) Photo taking

To take the photos we use a digital microscope Bysameyee 8-SA-00  to get photos with more details, a Canon EOS 70D camera with a 100 mm macro objective f/2.8L lens because it will be the camera used to perform the experiment and cardboard of different colours also used for the backgrounds (improves accuracy).

The images that were taken were divided into three different folders, one for wild flies, others for white flies and another for photos with both types of flies.
