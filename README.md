### 1.) DATASET PREPARATION
#### 1.1) Photo taking
In our case, to take the photos we use a digital microscope Bysameyee 8-SA-00  to get photos with more details, a Canon EOS 70D camera with a 100 mm macro objective f/2.8L lens because it will be the camera used to perform the experiment and cardboard of different colours also used for the backgrounds.
